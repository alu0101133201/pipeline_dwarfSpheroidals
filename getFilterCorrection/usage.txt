The scripts contained in this folder are for getting the filter correction that is applied
in the photometric calibration of the pipeline. This is needed because your filter and the filter of
the survey used for the calibration are not exactly equal.

To calculate your filter correction, first you have to download the gaia spectra using the script "donwloadGaia_Spectra.py"
Then you use the "getFilterCorrection.py" script, that will produce different image and data. The information that has to be introduced in
the pipeline are the coefficients of the colour correction (coefficients of the polynomial f(g-r))
