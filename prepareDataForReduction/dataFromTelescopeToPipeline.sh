# 1.- It rebins the data using the $rebinFactor argument
# 2.- It adds the headers of the reduced data to the raw data (we need to do this for reducing the data)
# 3.- It sorts all the data based on the filter
# 4.- It sorts all the data based on the date of the data

# If a filter ($6) is given it will only process data from that filter. Otherwise it will process
# the data of any filter
